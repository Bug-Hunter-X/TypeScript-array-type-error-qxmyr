# TypeScript Array Type Error

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error that arises when passing an array to a function expecting a single string.  The `greeter` function expects a string, but an array is provided, leading to a type error.

The solution involves modifying the function signature to accept an array or processing the array elements individually before passing them to the function.
